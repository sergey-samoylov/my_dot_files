+ bashrc (maybe I'll switch to Bash again from zsh - reason - all scripts work there)
+ vimrc
+ zshrc

===========

minor updates in .vimrc:

- added swap words option with "gw" (forward), and "gW" (backward)
- auto adding imports in Bash-scripts and Python code

udpdates in .zshrc:

- aliases are still in this file - to be corrected in future releases)
