# MY DOT FILES

**Update:**

- new structure for my dot files (each group in its folder)
- switched back to bash from zsh
- new prompt structure in .bashrc

## .bashrc

!["colors for venv & git statuses"](img/new_bash_prompt.png)

- need current time -> I work in "full screen" modes
- don't need usual username@host -> I know them + hostname
- full path as several projects might have similar structure + like it
- prompt with aqua ">" & red "$" for mistakes

!["red and '$' for errors"](img/new_bash_error_prompt.png)

### how to:

- rename files "bashrc" and "bash_prompt" -> add dots
- place in your $HOME
- place "aliasrc" and "aliasrc_bash_colors" into $/HOME/.config
- change colors and aliases to your likes and needs
- Enjoy!
